Objective:

Today, we're learning about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task:

Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

Input Format:

1.	The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
1.	The second line contains  space-separated integers describing array A's elements.

Constraints:
1.	1 <= N <= 1000
1.	1 <= Ai <= 10000, where Ai is the ith integer in the array.

Output Format:

Print the elements of array A in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

Sample Input:

1.	4
1.	1 4 3 2

Sample Output

1.	2 3 4 1
