Objective:

In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task:

Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

1.	If n is odd, print "Weird"
2.	If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print "Not Weird"
3.	If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print "Weird"
4.	If n is even and greater than 20, print "Not Weird"

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

Input Format:

A single line containing a positive integer, n.

Constraints:

1.	1 <= n <= 100

Output Format:

Print "Weird" if the number is weird; otherwise, print "Not Weird".

Sample Input 0

1.	3

Sample Output 0

1.	Weird

Sample Input 1

1.	24

Sample Output 1

1.	Not Weird

Explanation:

Sample Case 0: n = 3
1.	n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print "Weird."

Sample Case 1: n = 24
1.	n > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
